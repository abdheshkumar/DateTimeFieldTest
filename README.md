Test App For LiftWeb DateTimeField DateField Issue


To run simply run

		./run

This will install [Play! 2](http://www.playframework.org/) and start the app.

By default it connects to a local MongoDB server. You can change the MongoDB URI by setting the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable.

Once the app is running, you can run the `post` or `get` scripts to create a new **foo** document in the database or list all **foo** documents.


**N.B.:** The scripts requires [`curl(1)`](http://curl.haxx.se/) to be installed and in the `PATH`.
